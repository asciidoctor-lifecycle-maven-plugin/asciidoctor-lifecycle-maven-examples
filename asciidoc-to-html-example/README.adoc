= Asciidoctor Lifecycle Maven plugin: Asciidoc to HTML example

An example project that demonstrates how to convert AsciiDoc to HTML5 using the Asciidoctor Maven plugin
and the Asciidoctor Lifecycle Maven plugin

== Usage

Convert the AsciiDoc to HTML5 by invoking the `build` goal (configured as the default goal):

 $ mvn

Open the file _target/generated-docs/example-manual.html_ in your browser to see the generated HTML file.

Please, note that if you invoke the `package` goal you don't get nothing.
This is the expected result, because we are using the lifecycle.
